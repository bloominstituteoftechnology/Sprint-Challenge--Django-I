:disappointed_relieved: **Deployment Experiences** :cry:  
  
 The emojis by the title pretty much sums up my experience.  It's kind of difficult for me to gauge what went well since I was unable to get the app to deploy and with numerous changes (seen by the amount of commits), the error messages were always the same.  Searching frantically through to the most distant ends of Google did not turn up much help either.  About the only thing that went right was that I was able to create an app on Heroku, but deploying anything to that app was just not meant to happen today.  I'm assuming that the examples I found on google were all horrible examples to follow although I can't fully make that comparison until I have successfully completed the task and know all of what is actually involved in doing it correctly.  All in all, what I gained from this is that I have even less liking than I already did for Heroku coming into this.  It is touted as being a very easy platform to deploy to, but in actuality it falls short of being both easy, or likeable in my opinion.  There are just too many things that could be causing certain errors, and as you step through and try to fix it, you end up very uncertain if the steps you had taken that still availed to nothing, just further worsened the situation or if they actually helped.  The last time I deployed a react app to it I had the same issues, and ended up having to start over about 3 times until it finally worked.  I guess it's good to struggle sometimes with things, but I am near the point of disgust with the documentation that's available and the examples that are online and I just don't see how something can be this difficult to deploy after following the directions exactly as they were stated.  There was nothing too tricky, it's just nothing worked.
